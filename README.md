# Cyber WOLF
Web application Offensive Learning Firewall

## Abstract
Cyber WOLF is a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that leverages Machine Learning to detect and neutralize cyberattacks.
Contrary to most ML based WAF's, Cyber WOLF does not black list attack signatures.
Cyber WOLF uses ML to "learn" the signatures of normal HTTP requests.
This white list is then used to evaluate incoming requests before sending them to you web application.
Once the model is sufficiently trained, the model can be deployed in a WAF environment.
Here the model will judge each request's signature and will either allow, flag or deny a request based on the prediction of our ML model.
Although the model judges application layer HTTP requests, Cyber WOLF is implemented on the TCP layer of communications.
This package contains:
- A custom HTTP parser as part of [the preprocessor](https://github.com/Mathuiss/cyber_wolf/blob/main/rel/class_preprocessor.py).
- A [model building/training script](https://github.com/Mathuiss/cyber_wolf/blob/main/rel/class_training.py), powered by Tensorflow Keras.
- A [validation script](https://github.com/Mathuiss/cyber_wolf/blob/main/rel/class_validation.py) to evaluate your model with, based on custom cyber attacks, before deployment.
- A configurable [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://github.com/Mathuiss/cyber_wolf/blob/main/rel/cyberwolf.py).
- Some configuration files
